# MovieFinder

A basic search function that uses the IMDB suggest search API to search movies using Angular 2.0.

More or less my first Angular site.

Switch over to the `master` branch for the source code. You can access the live version of the movie finder at [https://frontalspy.github.io/imdb-movie-finder/](https://frontalspy.github.io/imdb-movie-finder/).

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required Angular and Gulp requirements.

Run `bower install` to install Foundation and other bower dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start the local server. Run `gulp` for styling and scripts in the /assets folder otherwise you can use your own in the component css files.


This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
